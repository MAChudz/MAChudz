- 👋 Hi, I’m @MAChudz
- 👀 I’m interested in absorbing as much information as possible with the goal of making a career shift to software development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and will then be learning Javascript. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me: the best way right now is via GitHub, but I'll be adding more options in the future.
